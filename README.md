# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction Using ML & DL

This capstone project aims to predict employee salaries using both Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. By analyzing features such as experience, education, job role, location, and skills, the system builds models that offer accurate salary estimates and helps demonstrate practical AI implementation.
